The surveys were conducted in the waters around Kodiak Island,\nAlaska, using pots similar to the pots used by the commercial fishing fleet.\n(A crab pot is a trap that resembles a wooden crate.)  A fixed sampling grid\nwas used to place strings of pots (stations) consisting usually of 10 pots in\nopen ocean, or of 2-5 pots in bays.  The pots were left in the water for\nperiods of 16-24 hours, removed, and the crab counts recorded.  The survey was\nconducted each summer, 2-4 weeks prior to start of the commercial fishing\nseason.  The crab counts are classified by size (roughly representing age) and\nsex into six categories.\n\nThe basic survey data is a file \"survey\", containing a 3,450 by 14 matrix\nwith these columns:\n\n      1.

For drawing maps, bear in mind that longitude is\nmeasured East to West, which is right to left.  This suggests plotting\nnegative longitude instead of longitude.  Also, to draw maps that \"look right\"\nto an Alaskan, you must take into account that in this part of the world the\naspect ratio of one degree latitude (y-axis) to one degree longitude (x-axis)\nis 1:1.8 (in terms of actual ground distance).",
