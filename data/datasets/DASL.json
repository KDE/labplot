Young Pima Indians often marry other Pimas, making them an ideal group for genetic researchers to study. Pimas also have an extremely high incidence of diabetes.\nResearchers investigating factors for increased risk of diabetes examined data on 768 adult women of Pima Indian heritage. One possible predictor is the body mass index, BMI, calculated as weight/height2, where weight is measured in kilograms and height in meters.

Each morning, she washed her hands according to the treatment randomly chosen. Then she placed her right hand on a sterile media plate designed to encourage bacteria growth. She incubated each plate for 2 days at 36Â°C, after which she counted the bacteria colonies. She replicated this procedure 8 times for each of the four treatments.",

The material used was a correlation table containing the height and left middle finger measurements of 3000 criminals, from a paper by W. R. MacDonell (Biometrika, Vol. I., p. 219).\" His method was to write the 3000 finger length values on cards, shuffle them thoroughly, and the deal out 750 hands of 4 cards. For each hand he then calculated (with a mechanical calculator) the mean and standard deviation. (Note; He divided by n (= 4) and not by n-1 (= 3).) He then found values of ybar - the population mean (which he knew because he had the population; it is 11.5474) and divided each by the standard deviation. The resulting values formed the distribution which he then correctly described.\nThe finger measurements were originally given in mm and the heights in feet and inches. They have been converted to cm (at https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/crimtab.html). The midpoint of intervals are used where MacDonnel gives a range of values.",

The researchers hoped to show that more regulation leads to lower GDP/Capita. The multiple regression with all terms does have a significant P-value for Economic Regulation Index.\nHowever, Primary Education is not a significant predictor. If it is removed from the model, then OECD Regulation is no longer significant at .05. Was it added to the model just to judge the P-value of OECD regulation down to permit a publication that claimed an effect?\nCheck to see whether you think there is such an effect.",

One is concerned with the ninety-nine Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander deaths in custody which occurred throughout Australia during the period 1 January 1980 to 31 May 1989. Issues around the causes of death, culpability of custodians and their employers, and the prevention of future deaths were addressed in depth. The second stream concerned what the Royal Commission called the 'underlying issues': the social, cultural, and legal factors which, in the view of the Commissioners, had some bearing on the deaths. These underlying issues, as revealed from the chapter headings of the Royal Commission's National Report, included the Legacy of History, Aboriginal Society Today, Relations With the Non-Aboriginal Community, The Harmful Use of Alcohol and Other Drugs, Schooling, Employment, Unemployment and Poverty, Housing and Infrastructure, Land Needs, and Self-determination. \nThe link between the Royal Commission's discussion of the individual deaths investigated, the prevention of future deaths and the underlying issues, is its position on the over-representation of Indigenous people in custody in Australia. A central conclusion of the Royal Commission, illustrating this point, was as follows: \nThe work of the commission has established that Aboriginal people in custody do not die at a greater rate than non-Aboriginal people in custody. \nHowever, what is overwhelming different is the rate at which Aboriginal people come into custody, compared with the rate of the general community ... The ninety-nine who died in custody illustrate that over-representation and, in a sense, are the victims of it. \nThe conclusions are clear. Aboriginal people die in custody at a rate relevant to their proportion of the whole population which is totally unacceptable and which would not be tolerated if it occurred in the non-Aboriginal community. But this occurs not because Aboriginal people in custody are more likely to die than others in custody, but because the Aboriginal population is grossly over-represented in custody. Too many Aboriginal people are in custody too often (Johnston, 1991, Vol 1, p6).",

Most airlines try to entice travelers to voluntarily give up their seats in return for free travel or other awards, but they do have to \"bump\" some travelers involuntarily. Of course, they donât like to offend passengers by bumping, so they are constantly trying to improve their systems for predicting how many passengers will show up. Have the rates of \"bumping\" changed?

She\nwished to investigate whether the color of the nail polish might make a difference.\nShe mounted acrylic nails on sticks and polished them with two different color nail polishes. She soaked them together in a chlorine solution equivalent to a swimming pool's chlorination and then tapped them 100 times on a computer keyboard to simulate daily stress. The response is the % of nail chipped off as measured by scanning images of the nails and using an image processing program.",
