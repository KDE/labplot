To do this she tested four different methods—washing with water only, washing with regular soap, washing with antibacterial soap (ABS), and spraying hands with antibacterial spray (AS) (containing 65% ethanol as an active ingredient). Her experiment consisted of one experimental factor, the washing Method, at four levels.\nShe suspected that the number of bacteria on her hands before washing might vary considerably from day to day. To help even out the effects of those changes, she generated random numbers to determine the order of the four treatments. Each morning, she washed her hands according to the treatment randomly chosen. Then she placed her right hand on a sterile media plate designed to encourage bacteria growth. She incubated each plate for 2 days at 36°C, after which she counted the bacteria colonies. She replicated this procedure 8 times for each of the four treatments.",

Known throughout history as a generous people, they have given of themselves for the past 30 years helping researchers at the National Institutes of Health study certain diseases like diabetes and obe-sity. Young Pima Indians often marry other Pimas, making them an ideal group for genetic researchers to study. Pimas also have an extremely high incidence of diabetes.\nResearchers investigating factors for increased risk of diabetes examined data on 768 adult women of Pima Indian heritage. One possible predictor is the body mass index, BMI, calculated as weight/height2, where weight is measured in kilograms and height in meters. We are interested in the relationship between BMI and the incidence of diabetes. ",

The material used was a correlation table containing the height and left middle finger measurements of 3000 criminals, from a paper by W. R. MacDonell (Biometrika, Vol. I., p. 219).” His method was to write the 3000 finger length values on cards, shuffle them thoroughly, and the deal out 750 hands of 4 cards. For each hand he then calculated (with a mechanical calculator) the mean and standard deviation. (Note; He divided by n (= 4) and not by n-1 (= 3).) He then found values of ybar – the population mean (which he knew because he had the population; it is 11.5474) and divided each by the standard deviation. The resulting values formed the distribution which he then correctly described.\nThe finger measurements were originally given in mm and the heights in feet and inches. They have been converted to cm (at https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/crimtab.html). The midpoint of intervals are used where MacDonnel gives a range of values.",

She randomly selected 41 of them, whom she informed (truthfully) that the work they do satisfies the Surgeon General’s recommendations for an active lifestyle, providing examples to show that their work is good exercise. The other 34 were told nothing. Various characteristics, such as weight, body fat, body mass index and blood pressure were recorded at the start of the study and again after four weeks. The researcher was interested in whether the information she provided would result in measurable physical changes. If there is a difference, it might challenge our understanding of the placebo effect because being informed could make a difference.",

These two datasets are blended into a single product to produce the combined global land and ocean temperature anomalies. The available timeseries of global-scale temperature anomalies are calculated with respect to the 20th century average, while the mapping tool displays global-scale temperature anomalies with respect to the 1981-2010 base period.

These\nbirds can also dive to depths of over 500 meters! Since air-breathing animals like\npenguins must hold their breath while submerged, the duration of any given dive\ndepends on how much oxygen is in the bird’s body at the beginning of the dive, how\nquickly that oxygen gets used, and the lowest level of oxygen the bird can tolerate.\nThe rate of oxygen depletion is primarily determined by the penguin’s heart rate.\nConsequently, studies of heart rates during dives can help us understand how these\nanimals regulate their oxygen consumption in order to make such impressive dives.The researchers equipped emperor penguins with devices that record their heart rates during\ndives. The dataset reports Dive Heart Rate (beats per minute), the Duration\n(minutes) of dives, and other related variables.",

With the help of satellite images, more and more craters have been identified; now more than 180 are known. These, of course, are only a small sample of all the impacts the earth has experienced: Only 29% of earth’s surface is land, and many craters have been covered or eroded away. Astronomers have recog-nized a roughly 35 million-year cycle in the frequency of cratering, although the cause of this cycle is not fully understood.\nThe data hold information about craters. craters from the most recent 35Ma (million years) may be the more reliable data, and are suitable for analyses relating age and diameter.",

If Rent index is 80, Numbeo estimates that price of rents in that city is on an average 20% less than the price in New York.\nGroceries Index is an estimation of grocery prices in the city compared to New York City. To calculate this section, Numbeo uses weights of items in the “Markets” section for each city.\nRestaurants Index is a comparison of prices of meals and drinks in restaurants and bars compared to NYC.\nCost of Living Plus Rent Index is an estimation of consumer goods prices including rent comparing to New York City.\nLocal Purchasing Power shows relative purchasing power in buying goods and services in a given city for the average wage in that city.

Because no two houses are exactly\nthe same, appraisers have to adjust comparable homes for\nsuch features as extra square footage, bedrooms, fireplaces,\nupgrading, parking facilities, swimming pool, lot size, location,\nand so on.

The NYSDOT condition rating scale ranges from 1 to 7, with 7 being in new condition and a rating of 5 or greater considered as good conditionBridges that cannot safely carry heavy vehicles, such as some tractor trailers, are posted with weight limits. Based upon inspection and load capacity analysis, any bridge deemed unsafe gets closed.\nHow does the condition of the bridge relate to its age? Are there any outliers?

One is concerned with the ninety-nine Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander deaths in custody which occurred throughout Australia during the period 1 January 1980 to 31 May 1989. Issues around the causes of death, culpability of custodians and their employers, and the prevention of future deaths were addressed in depth. The second stream concerned what the Royal Commission called the ‘underlying issues’: the social, cultural, and legal factors which, in the view of the Commissioners, had some bearing on the deaths. These underlying issues, as revealed from the chapter headings of the Royal Commission’s National Report, included the Legacy of History, Aboriginal Society Today, Relations With the Non-Aboriginal Community, The Harmful Use of Alcohol and Other Drugs, Schooling, Employment, Unemployment and Poverty, Housing and Infrastructure, Land Needs, and Self-determination. \nThe link between the Royal Commission’s discussion of the individual deaths investigated, the prevention of future deaths and the underlying issues, is its position on the over-representation of Indigenous people in custody in Australia. A central conclusion of the Royal Commission, illustrating this point, was as follows: \nThe work of the commission has established that Aboriginal people in custody do not die at a greater rate than non-Aboriginal people in custody. \nHowever, what is overwhelming different is the rate at which Aboriginal people come into custody, compared with the rate of the general community ... The ninety-nine who died in custody illustrate that over-representation and, in a sense, are the victims of it. \nThe conclusions are clear. Aboriginal people die in custody at a rate relevant to their proportion of the whole population which is totally unacceptable and which would not be tolerated if it occurred in the non-Aboriginal community. But this occurs not because Aboriginal people in custody are more likely to die than others in custody, but because the Aboriginal population is grossly over-represented in custody. Too many Aboriginal people are in custody too often (Johnston, 1991, Vol 1, p6).",

The researchers found that men watch, on average, about 2.5 hours per week more TV than women, and that varsity athletes watch about 3.5 hours per week more than those who are not varsity athletes. But is this the whole story? To investigate further, they divided the students into four groups: male athletes (MA), male non-athletes (MNA), female\nathletes (FA), and female non-athletes (FNA).",
