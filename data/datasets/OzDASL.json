One of the major safety problems encountered there has been the storage of radioactive wastes. Over the years, significant quantities of these substances - including strontium 90 and cesium 137 - have leaked from their open-pit storage areas into the nearby Columbia River, which flows along the Washington-Oregon border, and eventually empties into the Pacific Ocean. \nTo measure the health consequences of this contamination, an index of exposure was calculated for each of the nine Oregon counties having frontage on either the Columbia River or the Pacific Ocean. This particular index was based on several factors, including the county's stream distance from Hanford and the average distance of its population from any water frontage. As a covariate, the cancer mortality rate was determined for each of these same counties. \nThe data give the index of exposure and the cancer mortality rate during 1959-1964 for the nine Oregon counties affected.

The students took their own pulse rate. They were then asked to flip a coin. If the coin came up heads, they were to run in place for one minute. Otherwise they sat for one minute. Then everyone took their pulse again. The pulse rates and other physiological and lifestyle data are given in the data. \nFive class groups between 1993 and 1998 participated in the experiment. The lecturer, Richard Wilson, was concerned that some students would choose the less strenuous option of sitting rather than running even if their coin came up heads, so in the years 1995-1998 a different method of random assignment was used. In these years, data forms were handed out to the class before the experiment. The forms were pre-assigned to either running or non-running and there were an equal number of each. In 1995 and 1998 not all of the forms were returned so the numbers running and sitting was still not entirely controlled.",

The Program surveyed all aboriginal communities in Australia and attempted to contact all aborigines. Simultaneously, contact was made with non-aborigines usually living in the same or adjacent locations. Because of the high prevalence of infection in the aboriginal community only severe cases were classified as infected, virtually all of them suffering bursting of the ear drum and consequent scarring. It was thought that scarring could be used to identify those people who previously had had sever infections, but were not currently infected. So it was possible to classify subjects as (a) either not currently infected and no scarring, (b) currently infected or (c) not currently infected but one or more drums scarred.

A symptom of infection from this parasite, the number of red blood cells can be redu ced by up to 80% at the point of peak anaemia. The problem to be considered here concerns a way of quantifying the change in red blood cell populations during the recovery stages of the disease. \nIn a laboratory trial, cows were inoculated with the parasite and their red blood cells monitored before and after inoculation. The data collected were in the form of red cell volume distributions obtained from a Coulter counter, truncated and sorted into groups. In work as yet unpublished, McLaren et al. have addressed the problem of fitting distributions to similar data from humans suffering myelodysplastic anaemia, and McLaren (private communication) has suggested the need to develop hypothesis testing procedures for this type of data. \nThe observed counts of red cell volume from one of the cows on days 21 (Freq1) and 23 (Freq2) after inoculation are listed. The counts are grouped into 18 intervals of equal width of 7.2 fl. The first column (Group) lists the group number, the second (Vol) lists the truncated lower endpoint of the cell volume interval. The lower and upper truncation values for these red cell volume counts were 21.6 fl and 151.2 fl respectively. A cursory inspection of the two sets of observed frequency counts in histogram form on the logarithmic scale suggest that the red blood cell volume distribution is bimodal, at least at 21 days after inoculation. \n",

The main feature that distinguishes Reiki from other couch therapies, such as therapeutic touch, is that Reiki therapists have physical contact with the body. Participants in Reiki are fully-clothed and may be covered with a blanket if they wish. The treatment, delivered to 18 specific areas of the body, begins with the participant lying on his or her back. The hands are placed on 10 distinct locations on the head and torso. The participant is then asked to lie on his or her stomach (or side, if this is more comfortable), where the hands are placed on 8 additional distinct locations covering the back, hip area and feet. The treatment takes approximately 1.25 hours to complete. \nTreatment of cancer pain usually focuses on opioids. Since high doses of opioids frequently aggravate other common symptoms of cancer patients, it is of interest to explore non-drug treatments that may allow control of cancer pain with lower doses of opioids. This project studied whether Reiki is beneficial in the management of pain for people from the community experiencing general chronic pain, as a prelimary step in deciding whether Reiki is worth trying for cancer patients. \nThe Sample \nThe eligibility criteria were that subjects must be at least 18 years old, not receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy, be experiencing moderate pain (at least 3 on a VAS (0-10) or 2 on a Likert scale (0-5)), have normal cognitive function, be able to speak, read and write English, and be willing to complete the study rating scales. The sample size necessary was calculated using the binomial distribution with the assumption that 50% of the study participants might be expected to benefit from treatment. The probability of a decrease in pain following treatment in 14 or more cases out of 20 by chance alone is 0.058. [VAS means \"Visual Analogue Scale\". A Likert-type item consists of a single statement, followed by a usually five or six-point choice with each choice described in words.] \nNotices were placed in retail establishments and community centres. Potential participans identified themselves by telephoning the research assistant at a number provided on the recruitment posters. Individuals who met the eligibility criteria and who signed a consent form were scheduled to receive a treatment by a Reiki therapist. \nTwenty People were recruited (18 women and 2 men) who ranged in age from 23 to 62 years (mean 44 years). These participants were currently experiencing pain at 55 sites. Ten participants had pain in their upper body and 4 in their lower body. The remaining 6 participants had pain in both the upper and lower parts of their body. Eight participants attributed their pain to bone and muscle problems and 5 participants to chronic illness. Three of the participants included in the chronic illness group had cancer. Six participants had been experiencing pain for 1 year or less, and 7 had been experiencing pain for more than 1 year, up through 7 years. The remaining seven had been in pain for more than 7 years, one for 48 years. \nEighteen participants had asked their physician for help with their pain, and 19 were currently using at least 1 of the following strategies to manage it: analgesic preparations, anti-inflammatory medications, exercise, massage, acupuncture, therapeutic touch, chiropractic, homeopathy, meditation, vitamins, steam, muscle relaxation techniques and Tai Chi. \nTreatment and Data Collection \nParticipants were given 1 treatment by the Reiki therapist in her office. They lay on a massage table fully clothed and, if desired, were also covered with a sheet or blanket. The lights were dimmed, and a candle was lit; soft music played in the background. The environment was consistent through all 20 treatments. A pain VAS ranging from 0 to 10 and a Likert scale ranging from 0 to 5 were completed immediately before and after the Reiki treatment. ",

Do they just not process the material as thoroughly? One theory regarding memory is that verbal material is remembered as a function of the degree to which is was processed when it was initially presented. Eysenck (1974) randomly assigned 50 younger subjects and 50 older (between 55 and 65 years old) to one of five learning groups. The Counting group was asked to read through a list of words and count the number of letters in each word. This involved the lowest level of processing. The Rhyming group was asked to read each word and think of a word that rhymed with it. The Adjective group was asked to give an adjective that could reasonably be used to modify each word in the list. The Imagery group was instructed to form vivid images of each word, and this was assumed to require the deepest level of processing. None of these four groups was told they would later be asked to recall the items. Finally, the Intentional group was asked to memorize the words for later recall. After the subjects had gone through the list of 27 items three times they were asked to write down all the words they could remember. \n\n\n\n\nVariable\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAge\n\nYounger or Older\n\nProcess\n\nThe level of processing: Counting, Rhyming, Adjective, Imagery or Intentional\n\nWords\n\nNumber of words recalled\n",

The times at which 65 successive eruptions occurred from 1340 hours on 12 July 1998 were observed using a digital watch. \nJim Irish writes \nAnyone who has visited the Blowhole more than once knows that the rate and volume of eruptions varies. This variation occurs at several timescales. We might expect that part is explained by the tides, so that eruptions are more frequent and spectacular when the tide is very high, and eruptions obviously depend on the presence of a large ocean swell generated by prolonged strong winds over the ocean well offshore from Kiama. Hence, any stochastic model fitted to data observed over a short period of time is only applicable to that period, and perhaps a few hours either side of the observations. But we might infer from the model fitted to those data that a similar model applies more generally. ",

Measurements were taken downstream of an abandoned dump site that had previously been used by the pesticide industry to dispose of its waste products. \nIt was expected that these hydrophic substances might have a nonhomogeneous vertical distribution in the river because of differences in density between these compounds and water and because of the adsorption of these compounds on sediments, which could lead to higher concentrations on the bottom. It is important to check this hypothesis because the standard procedure of sampling at six-tenths of the depth could miss the bulk of these pollutants if the distribution were not uniform. \nGrab samples were taken with a La Motte-Vandorn water sampler of 1 litre capacity at various depths of the river. This sampler consists of a horizontal plexiglas tube of 7 centimetres diameter and a plunger of each side which shuts the sampler when the sampler is at the desired depth. Ten surface, 10 mid-depth and 10 bottom samples were collected, all within a relatively short period. Until they were analysed the samples were stored in 1-quart mason jars at low temperature. \nIn the analysis of the samples, a 250-millilitre water sample was taken from each mason jar and was extracted with 1 millilitre of either hexanes or petroleum ether. A sample of the extract was then injected into a gas chromatograph and the output was compared against standards of known concentrations. The test procedure was repeated two more times, injecting different samples of the extract in the gas chromatograph. The average aldrin and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) concentrations (in nanograms per liter) in these 30 samples are given in the data.",

Here is their description of the data and its collection: \n\"As keen fishermen out and about on a fairly regular basis, the common arguments arise between anglers on the best rigging set up for various conditions. We decided that upon our next group outing that we would back up our opinions with hard statistical facts. Our interest led us to test the most obvious variables in the fishing rig. \n\"Of interest were firstly the rod length, as between fisherman there always tends to be a variety of rods of different sizes; secondly the type of line, in that the larger the line it would be logical that the weight would increase; thirdly the sinker weight and how it affected the casting distance. \n\"In deciding on the three variables a 2^3 factorial design seemed obvious and for our purposes seemed to be quite adequate. So the question was placed as to whether or not the above variables in any combination made any difference to the overall distance the line was cast. The rods used were 6ft and 7ft two piece boat rods, fitted with the same type of spinning reel. The variable sinkers were 8oz and 12oz round ball sinkers and the line used was either the 1kg or 2kg line of the same make. \n\"The experiment was carried out on a day that was close to windless thus lowering the relative influence of the wind. The series of casts was conducted by the same person as were the measurements thus giving uniformity to the total experiment. A break of five minutes was timed between casts so as to allow the caster to allocate the same amount of energy to each cast. The rods were not rigged by the caster; a rigger would set the rod up with a combination of sinker, line and rod, and an effort was made to keep the caster oblivious to the changes in the rig. \n\"The experiment was conducted on the rugby ovals on Oleria St, Brookside (a western surburb of Brisbane) adjacent to the RSL (Returned Serviceman League club), which for all intents and purposes would be classified as a level surface. A line was placed at one end of the field and from it the caster would cast the rod as he would given normal fishing conditions. A spotter who was also the measurer would mark the point of impact of the sinker and from it measure back to the line from which it was cast. The distance observed was subsequently rounded up to the nearest 0.5 of a metre. Two runs were made of each combination. \n\"Possible improvements: Because of the time the rigging took, both casts with each rig were done at the same time. If we did it again it would be better to use random numbers to decide the order of all sixteen casts.\" ",

In this context, Delpino (1886) posed the \"ant-guard\" hypothesis to explain the role of extrafloral nectaries on plants. Extrafloral nectaries (EFN), distributed on species in over 80 plant families, occur on vegetative organs and \"outer floral parts\" not directly associated with pollination. Basically, the hypothesis states that extrafloral nectar production attracts pugnacious \"bodyguards\" (usually ants) which by their foraging activities deter the activities of herbivorous insects and seed predators. \nSince its inception, the ant-guard hypothesis has remained controversial. A few careful studies have experimentally demonstrated that ants attending EFN protect plants (von Wettstein, 1889; Inouye and Taylor, 1979; Schemske, 1980) while several recent studies showed no effect (O'Dowd and Catchpole, 1983; Tempel, 1983; Boecklen, 1984). O'Dowd and Catchpole (1983), for example, found that attendance of ants at EFN deterred other insects from developing flowerheads but that their presence decreased neither the numbers of seed predators nor damage to developing flowerheads. The object of this paper is to describe the ant-insect interactions by means of a simple probability model. \nFull experimental detail is provided by O''Dowd and Catchpole (1983) but an outline is as follows. The plants studied were helichrysum bracteatum. Three sites were chosen in clearings in the Tallaganda State forest, 40 km. southeast of Canberra, and at each site ten pairs of plants were studied. Plants within each pair were of similar initial size and less than 1 metre apart. Within each pair, ants were excluded from one plant, while the other served as a control. The plants were censused once a week for 17 weeks over the reproductive season (from initiation of flowerheads through the postflowering phase). The data recorded for each plant included the number of flowerheads (capitula), the number of capitula with ants, and the total number of other insects. Different species of ants (predominantly Iridomyrmex spp.) and other insects were observed, but in the data here are pooled within each general category. \nTo clarify: the first column (Week) lists the week the observation was made, the second (Index) lists the index given to the pair of plants observed, the third (AntCap) is the number of capitula on the plant with ant access, the fourth (ExcCap) is the number of capitula on the plant excluded from ant access, the fifth (Ants) is the number of capitula that have ants present on them, the sixth column (AntIns) is the number of insects on the plant with ant access, and the seventh (ExcIns) is the number of insects on the plant excluded from ant access. Index number 1-10 refer to Site 1, 11-20 to Site 2 and 21-30 to Site 3.",

Serventy carried out a detailed study of the lifecycle of the Tasmanian muttonbird (Puffinus tenuirostris, often called the short-tailed shearwater). The data here concerns the growth pattern of fledgling birds of this species. \nAfter the eggs hatch, the parent birds spend much time away from the next, and with increasing time their returns become rarer and rarer. When they return the young bird feed copiously, and there is very rapid weight-gain; whilst they are absent, the offspring loses weight. The result is not a smooth growth curve such as one finds in most measurements in developing animals and birds, but a 'sawtooth' effect. The data were collected in 1954 as weighings each morning of two fledgling chicks on Fisher Island, Bass Strait, and each set terminates on the day the chick left the nest. \nMuch of the interest in these curves comes not from the description they give of the weight of the chick, but from the information they contain on the feeding patterns of the parents. There are three obvious features of the data; the timing of the feeds and the size of the feeds when they occur, both of which represent aspects of the feeding pattern of the parents; and the loss in weight of the chicks between feeds. Henstridge and Tweedie (1984) proposed a model, similar to those used in storage theory, which describes each of these phenomena separately.",

It is rapidly gaining popularity in the US, Canada, Japan and parts of Europe. Recently, some of the rules of the game have been changed, with the aim of making play more exciting. In a study to examine the effects of the rule changes, Hollings and Triggs (1993) collected data on some recent games. \nTypically, a game consists of bursts of activity which terminate when points are scored, if the ball is moved out of the field of play or if an infringement of the rules occurs. In 1992, the investigators gathered data on ten international matches which involved the New Zealand national team, the All Blacks. The first five games studied were the last international games played under the old rules, and the second set of five were the first internationals played under the new rules. \nFor each of the ten games, the data list the successive times (in seconds) of each passage of play in that game. One interest is to see whether the passages were on average longer or shorter under the new rules. (The intention when the rules were changed was almost certainly to make the play more continuous.)

The implication was that the comparison was of some importance. However, larger countries would be expected to win more medals than smaller countries, simply because of their larger populations. \n... some viewers, especially those from the smaller countries, felt that the number of medals should be standardised to account for the very wide range of populations, and that a per capita number of medals for a country was a fairer comparison. Others felt that this was unfair to the countries with larger populations - that having twice as many people did not lead to twice as many medals. If standardisation is performed adequately, there should be no systematic relationship between the adjusted medal count and population. \nAlso countries further from the equator might be expected to do better in the winter olympics. \nThe data is incomplete in that countries with no medals are not included. These would be mostly smaller population countries. ",

It is rapidly gaining popularity in the US, Canada, Japan and parts of Europe. Recently, some of the rules of the game have been changed, with the aim of making play more exciting. In a study to examine the effects of the rule changes, Hollings and Triggs (1993) collected data on some recent games. \nTypically, a game consists of bursts of activity which terminate when points are scored, if the ball is moved out of the field of play or if an infringement of the rules occurs. In 1992, the investigators gathered data on ten international matches which involved the New Zealand national team, the All Blacks. The first five games studied were the last international games played under the old rules, and the second set of five were the first internationals played under the new rules. \nFor each of the ten games, the data list the successive times (in seconds) of each passage of play in that game. One interest is to see whether the passages were on average longer or shorter under the new rules. (The intention when the rules were changed was almost certainly to make the play more continuous.) \n",

Here is his description of the data and its collection: \nLiving at a squash court spurred on the idea of this experiment. Frustrated playing squash one night, I thought that the squash ball I was playing with seemed to bounce and react differently to what I was previously used to. So I conducted this experiment on the squash ball, looking at the type of ball, temperature of the ball and the age of the ball. \nBall type: In this experiment I used a 'yellow dot' squash ball and a 'double x' squash ball. A 'yellow dot' is super slow and a 'double x' is termed extra super slow. \nTemperature: When playing with a squash ball it tends to heat up. So I took it to extremes where I had 'room temperature' and 'playing temperature'. To duplicate 'playing temperature' the ball was placed in a cup of boiling water for 45 sec. \nAge: I expected age to be my most significant factor. Squash balls, being a sealed ball, shouldn't vary when they get older, so I used a new ball and compared it to an old ball. \nProcedure: I first thought of dropping the balls from a set height and seeing how far they bounced against a tape measure. This idea was scrapped as too much error came into it because you couldn't accurately measure when the maximum height of the bounce was. I then thought of a ball machine. I set the ball machine up and measured how far back did the ball come off the front wall when shot out of the ball machine. This eliminated a lot of varying in my figures as the ball machine shoots the balls out at roughly the same speed and trajectory. It doesn't take all the varying out as I wouldn't know whether the ball machine does shoot it out at exactly the same speed, but it keeps variation to a minimum. \nCriticism: Measuring the distance from the wall was done by my friend and I. We both would watch from different angles and would see where the ball landed. This means our figures are probably out by a couple of centimetres. When the balls were dropped into the water I forgot to take some of them out after 45 sec. Also with some I moved them around in the water to get the heat distributed evenly but others I forgot to move as I was collecting and organising the next ball. Another criticism is the temperature of the water. I put new boiling water into the cup after 4 balls had been in it. Therefore the last ball to go in wouldn't be the same temperature as the first ball.",

Chronic pain is often caused by muscle imbalances, which result in faulty alignment of and abnormal stresses applied to the spinal column. Muscle imbalances originate as adapations in motor control due to pain or external stimuli, and are then reinforced and preserved by repetition. \nThis study, conducted by Physiotherapy student Andrew Mooney, examined the flexibility of four major muscle groups associated with movement of the hip, with particular attention to imbalances between the left and right sides or between the dominant and non-dominant sides. \nA total of 33 male subjects were included in the study. The subjects were divided into three groups: 11 runners with low back pain, 11 runners without low back pain and 11 sedentary individuals without low back pain. (Runners were recruited from the Ashgrove and Toowong athletics clubs, non runners from the University of Queensland and the general community. Runners with lower back pain were recruited first. Once this subject group was tested, subjects for the two control groups were recruited to match the runners with low back pain according to age, height and weight.) \nThe muscle groups examined were \nthe iliopsoas, \nthe rectus femoris, \nthe tensor fascia lata/iliotibial band (ITB/TFL), and \nthe hamstrings \nFor each muscle group, two measures of flexibility were used. The first, relative flexibility, was related to the range of movement of the joint before postural compensations occurred, and the second was a measure of the maximal functional length of the muscle.

In considering this, the question arose, whether different types of paper and different angles of release would have any effect on the distance travelled. Knowing that paper aeroplanes are greatly influenced by wind, we had to find a way to eliminate this factor. We decided to perform the experiment in a hallway of the University, where the effects of wind can be controlled to some extent by closing doors. \nIn order to make the experimental units as homogeneous as possible we allocated one person to a task, so person 1 folded and threw all planes, person 2 calculated the random order assignment, measured all the distances, checked that the angles of flight were right, and checked that the plane release was the same each time. \nThe factors that we considered each had two levels as follows: \nPaper: A4 size, 80gms and 50gms\nDesign: High Performance Dual Glider, and Incredibly Simple Glider (patterns attached to original report)\nAngle of release: Horizontal, or 45 degrees upward. \nThe random order assignment was calculated using the random number function of a calculator.

I was interested to see how, by varying whether I ordered thick or thin crust, whether Coke was ordered with the pizza and whether garlic bread was ordered with the pizza, the response would be affected. \n``Because of my current financial status and limitation of time, I decided to have only two replicates, just to get a reasonable estimate of the variance. To decrease my financial burden I managed a deal with the manager of the pizza shop. I managed to get the pickup special, delivered to my house, which was the cheapest and smallest pizza made. I tried to repeat the experiment in as nearly as possible identical conditions to reduce `noise'. \n``I ordered the pizza from the same shop, being Domino's Pizza. To be consistent I ordered a Supreme pizza each time at approximately the same time of day. The response was measured from the time I closed the telephone to the time the pizza was delivered to the front door of my house. \n``I wrote each of the eight treatments on a piece of paper twice, put them all into a hat, mixed them up, and took them out one at a time to allocate the order in which each treatment was done. \n``As well as the response and treatment for each pizza delivery the actual hour of delivery was recorded, also the order in which the treatments were done and whether the driver was male or female.'' \n\n\n\n\nVariable\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCrust\n\nThin=0, Thick=1\n\nCoke\n\nNo=0, Yes=1\n\nBread\n\nGarlic bread.

One is concerned with the ninety-nine Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander deaths in custody which occurred throughout Australia during the period 1 January 1980 to 31 May 1989. Issues around the causes of death, culpability of custodians and their employers, and the prevention of future deaths were addressed in depth. The second stream concerned what the Royal Commission called the \u2018underlying issues': the social, cultural, and legal factors which, in the view of the Commissioners, had some bearing on the deaths. These underlying issues, as revealed from the chapter headings of the Royal Commission's National Report, included the Legacy of History, Aboriginal Society Today, Relations With the Non-Aboriginal Community, The Harmful Use of Alcohol and Other Drugs, Schooling, Employment, Unemployment and Poverty, Housing and Infrastructure, Land Needs, and Self-determination. \nThe link between the Royal Commission's discussion of the individual deaths investigated, the prevention of future deaths and the underlying issues, is its position on the over-representation of Indigenous people in custody in Australia. A central conclusion of the Royal Commission, illustrating this point, was as follows: \nThe work of the commission has established that Aboriginal people in custody do not die at a greater rate than non-Aboriginal people in custody. \nHowever, what is overwhelming different is the rate at which Aboriginal people come into custody, compared with the rate of the general community ... The ninety-nine who died in custody illustrate that over-representation and, in a sense, are the victims of it. \nThe conclusions are clear. Aboriginal people die in custody at a rate relevant to their proportion of the whole population which is totally unacceptable and which would not be tolerated if it occurred in the non-Aboriginal community. But this occurs not because Aboriginal people in custody are more likely to die than others in custody, but because the Aboriginal population is grossly over-represented in custody. Too many Aboriginal people are in custody too often (Johnston, 1991, Vol 1, p6).",

This question has produced a wide variety of theories from psychologists. An important early hypothesis was put forth by Holway and Boring (1940) who suggested that the illusion was due to the fact that when the moon was on the horizon, the observer looked straight at it with eyes level, whereas when it was at its zenith, the observer had to elevate his or her eyes as well as his or her head to see it. To test this hypothesis, Kaufman and Rock (1962) devised an apparatus that allowed them to present two artificial moons, one at the horizon and one at the zenith, and to control whether the subjects elevated their eyes or kept them level to see the zenith moon. The horizon, or comparison, moon was always viewed with eyes level. Subjects were asked to adjust the variable horizon moon to match the size of the zenith moon or vice versa. For each subject the ratio of the perceived size of the horizon moon to the perceived size of the zenith moon was recorded with eyes elevated and with eyes level. A ratio of 1.00 would represent no illusion. If Holway and Boring were correct, there should be a greater illusion in the eyes-elevated condition than in the eyes-level condition.",

The observations were made as part of the MACHO project. \nThe MACHO project monitors millions of stars every night with a dedicated telescope at Mount Stromlo Observatory. The collaboration is probing the halo of our galaxy in order to detect dark matter in the form of Massive Compact Halo Objects -- MACHOs. These are astronomical bodies that emit negligible visible light, such as dwarf or neutron stars, large planets, and black holes. Detection of a MACHO is achieved by observing its gravitational lensing effect on a chance background star as the MACHO crosses near the line of sight between the observer and this star. In order to detect a sufficiently large number of MACHOs, the project collects observations on an large number of distant stars over an extended period of time. Data are being collected daily over a 4-year period (weather permitting), on approximately 8 million stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the bulge of the Milky Way. \nThis database is a valuable resource for many other types of astronomical research. It is the most comprehensive catalog of stars in the LMC and contains stars much dimmer than those covered by previous surveys. Temporal coverage is unusually long compared to most star surveys, which permits a comprehensive study of star variability, including long periods and transient phenomena. About 40,000 variable stars have been observed in the LMC and a similar number in the galactic bulge. \nVariable stars are stars for which the intensity of the emitted energy changes over time; for periodic variable stars the change of intensity is periodic over time. Common types of periodic variable stars include eclipsing binaries, RR Lyraes, and Cepheids. Cepheids are very bright stars with periods of 1-70 days. The light curve has an asymmetric shape, and rises more rapidly than it falls. Cepheids with periods of about 1 week tend to have a bump in the descending part of the curve. For periods of about 10 days, the bump is at the peak of the curve, and for longer periods it is on the rising part of the curve. The brightness changes are caused by periodic pulsation (contraction and expansion) of the stars and their outer layers. \nThere are numerous additional types of variable stars, and each of the categories above contains subcategories. For example, Beat Cepheids and Beat RR Lyrae oscillate at more than one frequency. Different classes of variable stars can be located in different regions of a plot of magnitude versus temperature or spectral type. For example, RR Lyrae and Cepheids lie on a strip called the \"instability strip.\" Different types of variable curves are classified also on the basis of the shapes of their light curves and the relationships of shapes to period, for example. As well as being important for studies of stellar structure and evolution, these classes are used to determine distances on a cosmic scale by means of the relationship of their periods to their magnitudes. \nObservations of these stars are typically made at rather irregular times, depending on observation schedules and sky conditions. Different observations have differing errors. All this makes determination of the periods and the shapes of the corresponding phased light curves an interesting statistical problem. \nThis particular star is a category 1 Cepheid (magnitude -9.166) at coordinates (1541.5,1395.1).

                            "description": "The data gives a sequence of observations on the magnitude of an eclipsing binary variable star made from the Mount Stromlo Observatory near Canberra in Australia. The observations were made as part of the MACHO project. \nThe MACHO project monitors millions of stars every night with a dedicated telescope at Mount Stromlo Observatory. The collaboration is probing the halo of our galaxy in order to detect dark matter in the form of Massive Compact Halo Objects -- MACHOs. These are astronomical bodies that emit negligible visible light, such as dwarf or neutron stars, large planets, and black holes. Detection of a MACHO is achieved by observing its gravitational lensing effect on a chance background star as the MACHO crosses near the line of sight between the observer and this star. In order to detect a sufficiently large number of MACHOs, the project collects observations on an large number of distant stars over an extended period of time. Data are being collected daily over a 4-year period (weather permitting), on approximately 8 million stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the bulge of the Milky Way. \nThis database is a valuable resource for many other types of astronomical research. It is the most comprehensive catalog of stars in the LMC and contains stars much dimmer than those covered by previous surveys. Temporal coverage is unusually long compared to most star surveys, which permits a comprehensive study of star variability, including long periods and transient phenomena. About 40,000 variable stars have been observed in the LMC and a similar number in the galactic bulge. \nVariable stars are stars for which the intensity of the emitted energy changes over time; for periodic variable stars the change of intensity is periodic over time. Common types of periodic variable stars include eclipsing binaries, RR Lyraes, and Cepheids. Eclipsing binaries consist of two stars orbiting each other in a conformation relative to the observer such that brightness variability occurs as one star passes in front of the other in turn; as the stars may be of different brightness, the drop in light flux depends on which star is in the front. These stars have periods of between 3 hours and 24 years, although 0.5 to 10 days is the most common range. \nThere are numerous additional types of variable stars, and each of the categories above contains subcategories. For example, Beat Cepheids and Beat RR Lyrae oscillate at more than one frequency. Different classes of variable stars can be located in different regions of a plot of magnitude versus temperature or spectral type. For example, RR Lyrae and Cepheids lie on a strip called the \"instability strip.\" Different types of variable curves are classified also on the basis of the shapes of their light curves and the relationships of shapes to period, for example. As well as being important for studies of stellar structure and evolution, these classes are used to determine distances on a cosmic scale by means of the relationship of their periods to their magnitudes. \nObservations of these stars are typically made at rather irregular times, depending on observation schedules and sky conditions. Different observations have differing errors. All this makes determination of the periods and the shapes of the corresponding phased light curves an interesting statistical problem. \nThis particular star is a category 1 eclipsing binary (magnitude -10.26) at coordinates (1617.8, 669.35). Magnitudes were recorded in the blue band from 4500 to 6300 Angstroms. \n\n\n\n\nVariable \n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nTime\n\nTime of observation in days\n\nMagnitude\n\nDifferential Magnitude\n\nSD\n\nStandard deviation of the magnitude observation.
