Categorical variables observed for babies born in a metropolitan area of South Africa include race, whether or not the mother had medical aid (which is similar to health insurance), and whether or not the child was included in a follow-up study. The data are provided in two formats. The file birthtotena.dat contains the category labels and cell frequencies for the three-way table.  The file birthtotenb.dat lists each case on a separate line with three variables that indicate whether or not the mother had medical aid, whether or not the mother was traced for the five-year interview, and race.",
