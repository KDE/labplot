c++ code:

binary_motion.cpp and binary_motion_binary.cpp simulate Brownian motion and write the output to a file in ASCII or in the binary format, respectively.
To change the number of particle paths as well as the number of iterations adjust the corresponding parameters in the code.
To compile, use
* g++ brownian_motion.cpp -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm -o brownian_motion
* g++ brownian_motion_binary.cpp -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm -o brownian_motion_binary
