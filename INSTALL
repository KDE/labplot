===============================================================================
To build LabPlot execute
# ./compile

Edit the compile script if you want to use options different from default ones.
E.g. specify a custom installation path via
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local

or build a debug build via
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug


LabPlot's cmake configuration script searches for the optional packages and uses them if they are found.
To compile LabPlot without optional dependencies even if they are present on the system, use the following parameters (default is "ON"):
-DENABLE_FFTW=OFF
-DENABLE_HDF5=OFF
-DENABLE_NETCDF=OFF
-DENABLE_FITS=OFF
-DENABLE_LIBCERF=OFF
-DENABLE_CANTOR=OFF
-DENABLE_ROOT=OFF
-DENABLE_READSTAT=OFF
-DENABLE_MATIO=OFF
-DENABLE_MQTT=OFF
-DENABLE_QTSERIALPORT=OFF
-DENABLE_LIBORIGIN=OFF

Note, by switching off these libraries the feature set of LabPlot will be reduced.

To enable reproducable builds, use
-DENABLE_REPRODUCIBLE=ON
