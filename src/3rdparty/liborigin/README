liborigin, standalone version
---------------------

This code is a standalone library for reading OriginLab project files.

It is based on the code at
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/liborigin (upstream)
	https://github.com/SciDAVis/liborigin
	http://soft.proindependent.com/liborigin2 (not available anymore)

Additionally, some fixes were applied to silence UBSan warnings caused by
uninitialised POD struct members.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPILING: liborigin uses CMake for the building process.
		CMake is available at http://www.cmake.org/

After installing CMake on your system, issue the following commands:
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make
	$ make install

This will compile and install:
	a shared and a static version of liborigin library
	opj2dat, a program to extract data tables of an origin project into ASCII .dat files
	liborigin.pc a pkg-config metadata file to get compiler and linker flags
	c++ devel headers

To disable shared or static libraries (and opj2dat in the later case) you can also specify the cmake options
-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=off or -DBUILD_STATIC_LIBS=off.

Doc generation requires doxygen (http://doxygen.org)

To include liborigin in a project using cmake add
	find_package(PkgConfig)
	pkg_check_modules(liborigin liborigin>=3.0.0)
	target_link_libraries( my_target ${liborigin_LIBRARIES} )
	target_include_directories( my_target PUBLIC ${liborigin_INCLUDE_DIRS} )
to the project CMakeLists.txt file.

To include liborigin in a project using qmake add
	CONFIG += link_pkgconfig
	PKGCONFIG += liborigin
to the project.pro file.

Logging of origin file parsing process is deactivated by default.
To enable it define a GENERATE_CODE_FOR_LOG variable at the cmake command:
    $ cmake -DGENERATE_CODE_FOR_LOG=1 ..

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURES:
	* supports the import of any project from version 3.5 to latest (2021bSR0)
	* includes a pkg-config metadata file

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLES:
	* opj2dat (included) extracts the data tables of an origin project file into dat files
