-----2.0.0 (19.01.2014)-----
First stable release of LabPlot2. LabPlot2 is a complete rewrite of LabPlot1 and lacks in this release a lot of features available in the predecessor. On the other hand, the GUI and the usability is more superior as compared to LabPlot1 and there are several new features that were not available in LabPlot1.

Brief summary of features and capabilities of LabPlot2 implemented in the first release:
	* project-based management of data
	* created objects are organized in a tree and are visualized and accessible in the project explorer
	* for a better management of objects, additional folders and sub-folders can be created within a project
	* spreadsheet with very basic functionality is available for manual data entry
	* "file data source" can be used to import a file and to let LabPlot2 watch for changes in that file
	* external data from an ascii file can be also directly imported to a spreadsheet for further editing
	* worksheet is the main object where plots, labels etc. are placed on
	* several zooming functions for the worksheet
	* only cartesian plot is implemented in the first release
	* arbitrary number of freely positionable axes is possible
	* xy-curve is implemented. As the data source for the x- and y-values columns either from a spreadsheet
	  or from a file data source can be used
	* several zooming and "movement" functions are available for the plots which help to navigate through data
	* legend for xy-plots
	* a lot of properties of the worksheet elements can be edited in a very easy way in the corresponding dock widgets
	* plots on the worksheet can be put into a horizontal, vertical or grid layouts
	* export of worksheet (entire worksheet or current seleciton) to pdf, eps, png and svg
